# automated-alert-system
A system for automated data collection, translation, categorization, and alerting. It scrapes news and alerts from multiple sources (web, APIs, and documents), processes them with NLP (translation, summarization, classification), stores results in a searchable database, and delivers real-time alerts via email and a secure Next.js dashboard.
